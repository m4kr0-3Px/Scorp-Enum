# Scorp-Enum
 The reason for creating this tool is to discover subdomains and check if a website is http or https.
<br>This tool has two options, the first option is to discover subdomains. The tool will request a domain name from you. This will check whether the page is active or not with the GET request it will send to the domain address you will give. If the page is active, it will request a wordlist from you as the next stage. The subdomain you will give returns you which pages are active by trying the pages in the wordlist.<br>The other option asks you for a full file. This file is a list of pages that you want to check if they are http or https. It checks these pages one by one with the GET request and returns to you that the page is http or https with its own algorithm.
